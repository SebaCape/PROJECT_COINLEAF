PROJECT COINLEAF

This project is an iteration of my original idea to create a stock analyzer
with the Wolfram Language. Over time, my attention shifted to building a full-stack
web application with CRUD functionality instead, as I believe it will more efficiently
and broadly strengthen my abilities as a software developer.

This project will allow the management of an online cryptocurrency portfolio, leveraging
the CoinGecko API. I will have the opportunity to learn about databeses, RESTful APIs, 
App Deployment and Hosting, and the interaction of front and backend technologies.
More specifically, I will gain hands on experience with technologies such as AWS, MySQL,
Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Java, CSS, Bootstrap, Jackson, HTML, Gradle, and Postman.
